Information about how to work in this repository

All code changes will be done through merge requests (pull request in GitHub), code review enforcement is up to you.
I will lock access to main branch once initial structure is setup, aka you can only get changes into main via a branch -> MR procedure.
Try to keep it clean, I generated a .gitignore but if you notice it's missing something let me know/add it in a branch and just merge.
