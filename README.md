Information about how to work in this repository

All code changes will be done through merge requests (pull request in GitHub), code review enforcement is up to you.
I will lock access to main branch once initial structure is setup, and you can only get changes into main via a branch -> MR procedure.
Try to keep it clean, I generated a .gitignore but if you notice, missing something add it in your branch and merge.
